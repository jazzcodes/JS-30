    <h1>All magic on console </h1>

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // const team1=players;
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(team1);

    // team1[3]='Jazz';   
    // //changing the new, changes the original
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(team1);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // team2=players.slice();
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(team2);

    // team2[3]='Jazz'; 
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(team2);
// old one doesn't change coz copy is changed and not reference

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // team3=[].concat(players);

    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(team3);
    // team3[3]='Jazz'; 
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(team3);
    
// old one doesn't change coz copy is changed and not reference

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
//    const team4=[...players];

//     console.log(players);
//     console.log(team4);
//     team4[3]='Jazz'; 
//     console.log(players);
//     console.log(team4);

    // old one doesn't change coz copy is changed and not reference
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const cap1=person;
    // cap1.name="Jazz";
    // console.log(cap1.name);
    // console.log(person.name);

    // original changed coz we using reference and not copying the stuff

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // const cap2=Object.assign({}, person);
    // console.log(cap2.name);

    
    // const cap3=Object.assign({}, person, {name:'joy'});
    // console.log(cap3.name);
    // console.log(person.name);
    // we can overwrite without affecting old one
    // name not changes since copy only! 

    // Also, we can add newer properties without any conflict
    // const cap4=Object.assign({}, person, {name:'joy', school:'GNPS'});
    // console.log(cap4.school);
    // console.log(person.school);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // object ...spread works in react and not here 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
 
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

 
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //copied
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); 
    // convert an object into string and then parse it back into an object
    console.log(dev2);
    // poor man's deep clone for deep cloning but it isn't used much often .. there are better ways and also, we don't generally find any need to do such cloning.
   // deep clone - to clone more levels down
